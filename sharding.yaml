# Remember to enclose hashes in quotes to avoid casting to integer
# You should specify address in host[:port] format,
# where host can be either hostname, or IPv4, or IPv6 (in fact,
# everything that the 'Uri' class can process)
# Default port is 33131 (hardcoded in ShardingConfiguration.java)
#
# First replica is considered as 'master', the rest are 'slaves'
# Master has full copy of data, slave can have slightly outdated version.
# You cannot write to slaves, only master can push changes to them.
# All writes go straight to master
